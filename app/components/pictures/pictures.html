        My company is ArtWorks and I create pictures that are designed to inspire innovation, creativity and motivation. Art that is not just pretty but will engage people to want to look more closely and absorb the multidimensional energies of love, hope and renewal. Motivational art is not a new idea but most of the existing products look basically the same. My work can be customized to your favorite colors, brand colors and personalized inscriptions. All art is original and can be used in a variety of motivational materials designed with your home, office or business in mind. I am currently working with the Inspire Salon and Day Spa along with other local businesses to enhance their brands and extend their product lines. I am looking to connect with people who want to foster creativity, inspiration and innovation at work. Those who enjoy motivational art and are interested in surrounding themselves with personalized visual images and messages. - <a href="http://www.localimpactzone.com/biz/boise/artwork/boise-art-consulting#sthash.wlfKTqnC.dpuf">See more art of mine</a>
